This was a project I took up to learn and understand WebDev.
I used ReactJS to create a multipage website for my department student organisation called MetSA. 
The website has a simple landing page with a header, footer navbar and contents. 
The Initiatives menu of the Navbar leads to the second page of the website. I just made it to understand how routing works.
